# SQL
This repository is for practicing SQL queries. Today, I created a SQL file with a basic table and query.

## Goals:
- Learn basic SQL syntax.
- Practice writing queries.
- Build a small project using a database.

## Files Added Today:
- `select_queries.sql`: Contains examples of SELECT queries.
- `insert_queries.sql`: Contains examples of INSERT queries.
- `update_queries.sql`: Contains examples of UPDATE queries.
- `delete_queries.sql`: Contains examples of DELETE queries.

- ## Files and Folders:
